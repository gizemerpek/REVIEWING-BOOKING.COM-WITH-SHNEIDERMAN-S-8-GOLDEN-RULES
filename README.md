# REVIEWING-BOOKING.COM-WITH-SHNEIDERMAN-S-8-GOLDEN-RULES
The general purpose of this article was to determine how user-friendly the interface design of the 
booking application is, and to find this out, we made an analysis based on the findings we found by 
using Schneiderman's 8 golden rules. As a result of our investigations, we saw that the rules and 
compliance with these rules are important steps that must be followed in user-friendly interface 
designs. The biggest factor in reaching this conclusion is that while examining the booking 
application, we observed that the lack of implementation of the rules had a very negative impact on 
the user experience, while the implementation of the rules increased the user experience.
